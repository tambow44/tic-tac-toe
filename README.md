## Tic Tac Toe

My take on the classic `Tic Tac Toe` board game.

Console will appear as such:


```
            TIC TAC TOE

   Player 1 (X)  -  Player 2 (O)

              |     |
           1  |  2  |  3
         _____|_____|_____
              |     |
           4  |  5  |  6
         _____|_____|_____
              |     |
           7  |  8  |  9
              |     |
		   
   Player 1, enter a number: _
```

Console will utilise the terminal to clear the screen using `printf("\033[H\033[J");`. 

I have tested this on FreeBSD & RaspbianOS. I do not have any other machines to try. So, good luck if you somehow find this !
